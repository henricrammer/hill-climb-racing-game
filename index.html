        <h2>Getting Started with Hill Climb Racing Game</h2>
		<p><span class="highlight"><strong>Step 1: Launch and Grab Game Files</strong><br>Once you’ve got the emulator open on your phone, the first thing to do is find some hill climb. These are the files that let you play games like Pokémon or Mario. You can download them from safe sites online or pull them from your own GBA cartridges if you have a way to do that. Just make sure they’re legit to avoid any issues.</span></p>
		<p><span class="highlight"><strong>Step 2: Pick and Load Your Game</strong><br>Next, choose one of your favorite games from the ROMs you downloaded and load it into game. It’ll take a second to get ready—just let it finish. You’ll see your game pop up in the app, ready to roll whenever you are.</span></p>
		<p><span class="highlight"><strong>Step 3: Tweak It Your Way</strong><br>Open the game you picked and mess around with the controls and settings to make it feel right for you. Want the buttons bigger? Move them around? You can do that. Adjust the gameplay stuff like speed or graphics too—make it fit how you like to play.</span></p>
		<p><span class="highlight"><strong>Step 4: Set Up Quick Access</strong><br>To save time later, set a shortcut for your game. This lets you jump straight into it with one tap instead of digging through menus every time. Once you’ve got it how you want, save your changes so everything sticks.</span></p>
		<p><span class="highlight"><strong>Step 5: Start Playing</strong><br>Now you’re all set—launch your racing game and dive into the fun! Whether it’s battling in an RPG or racing through levels, you’re ready to enjoy it all with Hill Climb’s smooth setup. Sit back, play, and have a good time</span></p>
